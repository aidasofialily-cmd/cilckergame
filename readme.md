# Simple Clicker Game

This is a small, single-page clicker game built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It runs entirely in your browser and stores progress in localStorage.

Features:
- Click to earn points ("total")
- Upgrades that increase per-click value or add CPS (coins per second)
- Auto-save (toggle), manual save, and reset
- Keyboard shortcut: SPACE to click
- Number abbreviation (K/M/B/T)

How to run:
1. Save the three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Ideas for next improvements:
- Add sound effects and animations
- More upgrade types and scaling curves
- Prestige/rebirth mechanic
- Leaderboard (requires backend)
- Mobile-specific UI improvements

Enjoy! If you'd like, I can:
- Add more upgrades or prestige mechanics
- Make it mobile-first with responsive UX improvements
- Package it as a GitHub Pages site and provide a repo scaffold
